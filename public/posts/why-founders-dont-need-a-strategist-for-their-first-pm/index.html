    <div class="content e-content">
      <p>I recently had a conversation with the CEO of a scrappy, small, and profitable startup. Let’s call him Mike.</p>
<p>Mike’s company is pulling in a few million dollars annually with a lean team. They’ve navigated the waters of early-stage survival, but now they’re facing a familiar challenge: growth. What’s next? How do they scale?</p>
<p>These are tough questions, and it seemed like Mike and his team weren’t aligned on the answers.</p>
<p>From what I could gather, Mike is focusing on their buyers — adding features like loyalty programs, promotions, and customer acquisition tools. Meanwhile, his team is more interested in serving the practitioners — the users interacting with the product daily. The team wants to reduce pain points, automating workflows, and fixing bugs. Classic long-term vs. short-term split, but it&rsquo;s also a split on which user to prioritize.</p>
<p>Startups never have the resources to pursue both directions at once. The sense I got — though I can’t say for certain — was that Mike had already formed a preference but was hesitant to articulate it outright. When he asked whether a product management course might help his team with prioritization, I wondered if he was really seeking clarity or just hoping for reinforcement.</p>
<h2 id="the-disconnect-between-vision-and-execution">The Disconnect Between Vision and Execution <a href="#the-disconnect-between-vision-and-execution" class="anchor">🔗</a></h2><p>This tension isn’t unique to Mike’s company. It&rsquo;s common in most startups, particularly those led by founders who are involved in the product’s creation. Many founders act as the de facto product manager in the early days, shaping every detail. Over time - as their responsibilities expand, they spend less time in the trenches. Then they wake up one day to find the team working on things that feel misaligned with their vision.</p>
<p>Mike can’t — or shouldn’t — micromanage the team&rsquo;s decisions. But the team is not aligned. They are acting on biases based on who they interact with most. Mike spends his time pitching to buyers and closing deals, while his team hears daily from practitioners about bugs and feature requests.</p>
<h2 id="reflecting-on-my-own-experience">Reflecting on My Own Experience <a href="#reflecting-on-my-own-experience" class="anchor">🔗</a></h2><p>Mike’s situation reminds me of my days as a PM at a Y-Combinator startup. At Checkr, I was the second PM, working under a talented but relatively inexperienced director. One of our biggest responsibilities was to translate the founder’s vision into an actionable roadmap for the team.</p>
<p>This wasn’t about lofty strategizing — it was pure alignment. The challenge wasn’t just deciding what to build; it was keeping the team motivated and connected to the bigger picture, especially when their daily work felt tedious or reactive.</p>
<h2 id="the-role-of-mikes-first-pm">The Role of Mike’s First PM <a href="#the-role-of-mikes-first-pm" class="anchor">🔗</a></h2><p>When Mike circled back, he mentioned that instead of enrolling his team in a course, he wanted to hire a product manager. This seemed like a positive step, but it got me thinking about the broader dynamics of hiring PMs.</p>
<p>Usually, when companies bring on a product manager, the need falls into one of two camps: execution or strategy. Execution-focused PMs excel at translating high-level priorities into actionable plans. The risk for them, professionally, is that they might devolve into glorified project managers, moving tickets around in Jira without shaping the product&rsquo;s direction.</p>
<p>Strategy-focused PMs are about the big-picture. Market trends, customer needs, and long-term vision. Both sides are vital for a well-rounded PM, but most of us lean toward one or the other. In my opinion, for a company at Mike’s stage, the immediate need is to hire someone on the execution side.   That’s not to say strategy matter a bit later.</p>
