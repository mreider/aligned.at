      <description>The basics are in place. Kids have beds and bed frames. We do too. Everyone has a place to put their clothes. There is a dining room table with some temporary folding chairs. A desk in Zoe’s room and some bedside tables.&#xA;The bathroom has a new washer &amp;amp; dryer wedged between the sink and shower. They are supposed to stack, but they don’t stack very well, and this works — at least for now.</description>
