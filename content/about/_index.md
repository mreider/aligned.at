I’m a product leader with expertise in cloud-native technologies, AI, and observability tools. Since 1992, I’ve been immersed in the software industry’s most significant transformations—from Client/Server computing and the early Internet to J2EE, cloud computing, and AI.

I'm good at driving alignment across teams and organizations, which might be a psychological hand-me-down from my father and grandfather, both psychiatrists. 

I'm originally from Boston, lived in Silicon Valley for 20 years, and settled in Vienna, Austria, where I live with my wife and two kids.

If you’re dealing with product or organizational challenges — especially where there’s a divide between teams, founders, or the overall vision — I’d love to chat. Just [buy me a coffee](buymeacoffee.com/mreider) and book a time via [Calendly](https://calendly.com/mreider-l3yw/30min).
