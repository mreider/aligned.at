Every night at 9:00 PM, I walk my dog, Leo, while listening to podcasts like **Hidden Brain** with Shankar Vedantam. In a [recent episode](https://hiddenbrain.org/podcast/the-benefits-of-mixed-emotions/), Naomi Rothman discussed how society favors leaders who project certainty over ambivalence—often preferring confident leadership even when it’s based on incomplete or inaccurate information. She cited a study where CEOs admitting uncertainty during earnings calls were judged more harshly and seen as less competent, despite their honesty.

This tendency to favor confident leaders helps explain the prevalence of bullshit (as [George Carlin noted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ym12wnIWh-U), the world is full of it). Yet, labeling it this way overlooks the fact that we, as a society, expect and reward this behavior in our leaders.

Rothman:

> Everyone wants a leader to be black and white because otherwise, they might look inauthentic if they change and are inconsistent. We think they will help us and provide us with certainty about how to act. And it's very interesting to notice that that does seem to have emerged as the prototypical model of what it looks like to be a leader.

It’s easy to see ambivalence as a weakness. Are we just getting the bullshit we ask for—served up hot on a cafeteria tray from corporate catering? Probably. Most of us prefer confident leaders, even when they’re wrong. They give us the clarity we crave, truth be damned.

Some leaders, however, embrace ambivalence and cut through the bullshit. Instead of pushing for certainty, they sit on the same side of the table with their teams. This often happens in complex situations that need collaboration and problem-solving. In Product Management, this kind of teamwork is key, with leaders working as peers rather than bosses.

Rothman (again):

> What we have found across three separate studies is that leaders who are ambivalent seek more information from their team members, and team members start seeking more information from each other, and the team performs better compared to when leaders experience less ambivalence.

Product managers navigate incomplete data, vague feedback, and overwhelmed teams, making decisions without total clarity. It’s not glamorous, but it keeps us grounded in truth and away from the facade Harry Frankfurt, author of *On Bullshit*, describes as "confidence without understanding."

Product Managers also have an outward-facing role where confidence and decisiveness are essential, like presenting to customers or convincing leadership teams. The difference is this confidence feels earned, by dealing with uncertainty and understanding the problem firsthand. It’s not bullshit; it’s sincerity—or so I tell myself. Those who know me might say I’m full of shit too.
